# project_landpage
Odin Project landing page project.

This is a landing page project as part of The Odin Project Foundations course. It is the first project that started completely from scratch. Only two example images were given as guidelines for the appearance of the finished page. I made it up as a page for a fictitious construction company. It was a challenge trying to figure out how to make it look similar to the example images and to make everything wrap decently when resizing viewing width. Divs were used more often than I would like. This is because I don't yet understand which elements to use in which places. This project forced a lot of independent research and referencing of past projects and lessons to accomplish. While I am happy with the outcome, I realize there is much room for improvement. 

Images are all my own.
